# VueJS-with-Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

## Cypris install
```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress
npx cypress open
npx cypress run
```

### let's write a test for your Vue app. We'll create a new test file in the 
cypress/integration folder. You can name it app_spec.js
describe('Vue app basic tests', () => {
beforeEach(() => {
// Point to where your Vue app is hosted
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080');
});

it('Displays the logo', () => {
cy.get('.logo').should('be.visible');
});

it('HelloWorld component displays the correct message', () => {
cy.get('.wrapper').contains('You did it!');
});

it('TheWelcome component is rendered', () => {
cy.get('main').find('TheWelcome').should('exist');
});
});



Explanation:
Setup: The beforeEach hook tells Cypress to load your Vue app before each test runs. You need to adjust the URL (http://localhost:8080) to match where your Vue app is served during development.
Logo Test: The first test checks if the logo is visible on the page.
HelloWorld Test: The second test checks if the HelloWorld component is rendering correctly with the specific message "You did it!"
TheWelcome Component Test: The third test ensures that the TheWelcome component exists within the main tag.
Step 4: Running Tests
Run the tests by using the Cypress Test Runner or by running npx cypress run in your terminal. This will execute all the tests and provide you with the results.

Note:
Make sure your Vue app is running (usually with npm run serve or similar) when you run the tests.
Adjust any selectors or expected texts to match the exact content and structure of your application as it develops.
This setup should help you get started with basic testing of your Vue components using Cypress. As your app grows, you can continue adding more specific tests to cover other aspects like user interactions and state management.
